INTRODUCTION
   Z80 disassembler in Emacs Lisp

HISTORY
   I needed to dig through some 1980s vintage Z80 programs to try and
   track down a problem.  I had the executables but no source.

   I only had access to a Windows NT box which had previously been
   used for Java development.  I initially planned to write a Z80
   disassembler in Java but on finding that the box also had Emacs
   installed I switched to Emacs Lisp.

   I started on 1997-11-17 and stopped on 1998-01-05 when I had enough
   of a working disassembler for my purposes.  Between those days I
   worked on it on 9 separate days and for a total of 25 hours and 56
   minutes i.e. on average almost 3 hours each of the 9 days.

BUILD
   To speed up disassembly it is best to byte-compile all the files :-

      $ make all

RUN
   Since it is written in Emacs Lisp it is meant to be used interactively.
   So, in an Emacs *scratch* buffer do :-

      (setq load-path (cons "." load-path))
      (load-library "z80-dis")

   to load the code and now to disassemble the first 10 instructions of "sort.bin"
   first load the file and create a disassembler on it :-

      (setq *d* (z80-dis-from-file "sort.bin"))

   Now you can disasemble any section of it tha you want, the
   following disassembles the first 10 instructions :-

      (z80-dis *d* 0 10)
      0000 0e00     LD	C, 0
      0002 214000   LD	HL, 64
      0005 46       LD	B, (HL)
      0006 05       DEC	B
      0007 23       INC	HL
      0008 7e       LD	A, (HL)
      0009 23       INC	HL
      000a be       CP	(HL)
      000b 3007     JR	NC, 0014
      000d 56       LD	D, (HL)

     Table 3-4 on pages 3-23 to 3-39 contains a summary of the Z80
     instructions ordered by type i.e. I/O, block transfer, ... etc.
     The table also listes the order code, number of bytes, clock
     cycles and affect on flags.

     Table 3-5 on pages 3-40 to 3-42 has a table listing the
     instructions in numeric order.

     Pages 3-43 to 3-163 contain a detailed description of each
     instruction ordered alphabetically.

     Pages 9-10 through 9-14 contains an 8-bit bubble sort which
     includes the hex machine code as well as the assembly code.
